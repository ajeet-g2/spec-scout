⚠ Spec Scout Recommendation

spec/controllers/users_controller_spec.rb:28

Summary:
- Factory :user used `create` (1x)
- Factory :organization used `create` (1x)
- DB inserts: 2, selects: 4
- Runtime: 180ms
- Type: controller spec

Agent Signals:
- Database Agent: DB unclear (? LOW)
- Factory Agent: prefer build_stubbed (⚠ MEDIUM)
- Intent Agent: integration test behavior (⚠ MEDIUM)
- Risk Agent: potential side effects (⚠ MEDIUM)

Final Recommendation:
⚠ Consider replacing `create(:user)` with `build_stubbed(:user)`
Confidence: ⚠ MEDIUM

Reasoning:
- Mixed signals from database usage analysis
- Controller specs may benefit from stubbed factories
- Some integration behavior detected - review test boundaries
- Potential side effects identified - proceed with caution
- Manual verification recommended before applying changes

— Spec Scout Recommendation

spec/integration/user_workflow_spec.rb:15

Summary:
- Factory :user used `create` (2x)
- Factory :post used `create` (5x)
- DB inserts: 7, selects: 12
- Runtime: 420ms
- Type: integration spec

Agent Signals:
- Database Agent: DB required (✔ HIGH)
- Factory Agent: create required (✔ HIGH)
- Intent Agent: integration test behavior (✔ HIGH)
- Risk Agent: safe to optimize (✔ HIGH)

Final Recommendation:
— No optimization recommended
Confidence: ✔ HIGH

Reasoning:
- Database persistence is required for this integration test
- Factory strategy is appropriate for test type
- Test correctly exhibits integration behavior
- Current implementation is optimal for test intent
- No performance improvements available without changing test scope

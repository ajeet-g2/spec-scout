✔ Spec Scout Recommendation

spec/models/user_spec.rb:42

Summary:
- Factory :user used `create` (3x)
- Factory :post used `create` (2x)
- DB inserts: 5, selects: 8
- Runtime: 245ms
- Type: model spec

Agent Signals:
- Database Agent: DB unnecessary (✔ HIGH)
- Factory Agent: prefer build_stubbed (⚠ MEDIUM)
- Intent Agent: unit test behavior (✔ HIGH)
- Risk Agent: safe to optimize (✔ HIGH)

Final Recommendation:
✔ Replace `create(:user)` with `build_stubbed(:user)`
Confidence: ✔ HIGH

Reasoning:
- No database persistence required for this test
- Factory creates unnecessary database records
- Test exhibits unit test behavior patterns
- No risk factors detected (no after_commit callbacks)
- Potential performance improvement: ~60% faster execution
